METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

We extract a part of road graphs of some cities using https://www.openstreetmap.org/ and the presented source code in https://github.com/AndGem/OsmToRoadGraph. Note that, all the selected maps include at least one emergency center such as a hospital or fire station. We define the weight of the connections as the travel time for the corresponding connection in the network.
